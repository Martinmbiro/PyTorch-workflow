Hello again 👋
+ This repository demonstrates the steps followed in creating, training and evaluating a simple Artificial Neural Network using the [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) library. To do this, I've trained two Artificial Neural Networks (on toy datasets) for linear regression tasks
+ Comments, working code, and links to the latest official documentation are included every step of the way
+ There's links to open each individual notebook in Google Colab - feel free to play around with the code


## Milestones 🏁
**Concepts covered in this exercise include:**  
1. [x] Data wrangling and visualization
2. [x] Training and evaluating linear regression models - build using [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) neural networks

## Tools ⚒️
1. [`Google Colab`](https://colab.google/) - A hosted _Jupyter Notebook_ service by Google.
2. [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) -  An open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language, that is used for building **Deep Learning models**
3. [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#) - A free open-source library that offers Machine Learning tools for the Python programming language
4. [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
5. [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) - A comprehensive library for making static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python

## Results 📈
> Where a lower value (values close to `0`) indicates a better model fit, the _final_ model achieved the following scores:
+ [`mean_squared_error`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html#sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error) = `0.401`
+ [`mean_absolute_error`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html) = `0.583`

> On a scale of `0` -> `1`, the _final_ model achieved:
+ [`r2_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html) = `1.000`

> The saved models can be found in the `models` folder of the current repository.
